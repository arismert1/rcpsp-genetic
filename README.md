# rcpsp-genetic

This is one of my projects in University. It is basicly a simple solver for the RCPSP using a stohastic constructive and a simple evolutionary algorithm.
I use as input the file "model.txt" and its format is:
1st column: Activity name
2nd column: Activity's duration
3rd column: Activity's demand
4th-nth column: Activity's predecessors

Note: If you change the input file you must change the #define parameters in the "rcpsp.h" file.

Feel free to copy and use it.
